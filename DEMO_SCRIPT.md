## 🎯 Part 2: Kiro Features Showcase (3 minutes)

### 1. Specs

**[Open spec.md]**

"Everything started with a conversation. I told Kiro: 'Build a haunted confession app.'

Kiro created this comprehensive spec document with:
- Feature breakdown
- Design system
- Implementation phases
- Success metrics

This became our blueprint for the entire project."

### 2. Steering Docs

**[Open .kiro/steering/horror-design-system.md]**

"This is where the magic happens. Steering docs are automatically included in every conversation with Kiro.

Look at these rules:
- 'Never use pure white - always ghost white'
- 'Nothing is static - everything moves'
- 'Combine multiple animations'

Kiro follows these rules automatically. I never had to repeat myself."

**[Open .kiro/steering/accessibility-horror.md]**

"This one is conditional - only activates for HTML/CSS/JS files.

It ensures accessibility without compromising horror:
- Reduced motion support
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader compatibility
- WCAG compliance"

### 3. Agent Hooks

**[Open .kiro/hooks/ folder]**

"Three types of automation:

**On Session Start**: Reminds me about horror theme when I start working

**Manual 'Spookify'**: A button I can click to make any file MORE haunted

**On Save**: Automatically checks JavaScript files for errors every time I save"

**[Demonstrate by saving a file]**

"This catches bugs immediately, no manual testing needed."

### 4. Vibe Coding

**[Show chat history if available]**

"The entire app was built through natural conversation:

Me: 'Make the planchette follow the cursor'
Kiro: *implements smooth tracking*

Me: 'Add more glitch effects'
Kiro: *enhances with multiple variations*

Me: 'The confessions need to decay over time'
Kiro: *adds fade and blur animations*

No boilerplate. No repetition. Just describe what you want."

"60fps animations throughout:
- 80 simultaneous particles
- 30+ CSS animations
- Real-time updates
- Zero framework overhead"

### Real-time Architecture

**[Open two browser windows side by side]**

"Watch this - I'll submit a confession in one window..."

**[Submit confession]**

"...and it appears instantly in the other window. Server-Sent Events for real-time updates."

### Accessibility

**[Toggle reduced motion]**

"Reduced motion mode - still haunted, just gentler."

**[Tab through interface]**

"Full keyboard navigation with glowing focus states."

**[Open screen reader]**

"Screen reader compatible with atmospheric descriptions."

### Sound Design

**[Open browser console showing Web Audio API]**

"All sounds generated with Web Audio API - no external files:

Dynamic mixing based on user activity."
